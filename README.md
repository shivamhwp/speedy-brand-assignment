- nextjs
- tailwindcss
- shadcn

-process and tradeoffs.

- I used nextjs for the project because it is a react framework that is easy to use and has a lot of features that make it easy to build a web application. the tradeoff is that it is a bit heavy and might not be the best choice for a small project, but for a big web app like yours, i think it is the best choice. also there is use of stock data in it, resulting in little code duplication and a bit of complexity in the code. but using a database and production backend can easily solve this issue.
